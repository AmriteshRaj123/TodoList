# React Redux Todo App

This repository contains a simple Todo application built with React and Redux, allowing users to add, view, edit, and delete tasks. The application consists of two main components: Form and Todos, and uses Redux for state management.

## Features

- Add new tasks
- View existing tasks
- Edit task names
- Delete individual tasks
- Delete all tasks at once
- Toggle task completion status

## Components

### Form Component

The Form component allows users to add new tasks to the list. It includes functionality to handle adding new tasks and updating existing ones.

### Todos Component

The Todos component displays the list of tasks. It includes functionality to handle editing, deleting, and toggling task completion status.

## Redux Actions and Reducer

The Redux store manages the state of the application using actions and reducers. The actions include adding, deleting, updating, and toggling tasks, while the reducer handles the state updates based on these actions.
